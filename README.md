# Innomatics Hackathon on "Netfiz" Dataset :
Recently, I participated in a 5-hour Live Hackathon conducted by Innomatics Research Labs. It was an amazing experience being able to take part in such a wonderfully planned virtual coding event, and I learned so much during the entire process.

The idea was to do 'Explore the Data and to tasks on Netfiz dataset'. It was done with the help of Python and I used various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and BeautifulSoup.
It has been an enthralling experience that has helped me continue to expand my knowledge.
